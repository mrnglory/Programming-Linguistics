# Programming-Linguistics
This repository is a collection of assignments from the Programming Linguisticse class in the first semester of 2019. Honestly, it was so difficult that I couldn't finish it properly as time passed, but it was a valuable experience that I couldn't easily get anywhere.
1. Report writing with LaTeX
2. Binary search, quick sort, merge sort, traversal with Python
3. Lex
4. Yacc
5. Call Graph
6. Top of Hanoi, quick sort, nQueen, minimum path with Prolog
